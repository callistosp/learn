# learn

## Pre-workshop
- AdvRWorkshop_InstallAndTest.R has been updated to have the most up-to-date install procedure that should work on Windows and Mac

## Week One:
- Completed slide decks deck_00, deck_01, and deck_02
- Basic model loading code located in file codeAlong1.R
- Worked through workbook.Rmd problems: warm-up, Z-pak, and secukinumab
- Answers for workbook.Rmd located at bottom of file

## Week Two:
- Wrote simple.cpp model file (located in the learn main directory, not the model directory)
- Wrote model_spec.R for running simulations with the simple.cpp file
- Wrote mero.cpp model file, which uses NMXML functionality to load data from previous NONMEM run
- Code at the bottom of model_spec.R was used to run the mero.cpp simulations

## Week Three:
- Continued using the meropenem model to do additional analyses; code located in day3codealong.Rmd
- Did basic coding with OPG example; code located in opg2.R file
- Went through entire OPG example in handson_opg_answer.Rmd (no live coding, just reviewed Kyle's completed answer)
- Kyle suggested we work through the file trouble.R, which contains a bunch of errors that you should be able to debug and fix. Great practice in identifying typos in your own code!
